# recreatingThePast

recreating the past / sfpc 2015

Each week, we take a look at a different famous media artwork that have been made in code and recreate them from scratch, discussing the algorithmic approaches and tools, as well as poetic underpinnings.  By recreating these works, we can investigate also what modern tools and approaches have to offer.  We will also look at broader examples about what the artwork teaches us about code and algorithmic approaches.  For example, seminal works like Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv's "Text Rain" can be used as a starting point for discussing computer vision based interaction.  The class takes inspiration from the re:code project which aims to recode older media artworks, and participants will be invited through homework assignments to contribute.
