# Recreating the Past

recreating the past / sfpc 2015

Each week, we take a look at a different media artworks that have been made in code and recreate them from scratch, discussing the algorithmic approaches and tools, as well as poetic underpinnings.  By recreating these works, we can investigate also what modern tools and approaches have to offer as well as study how code was used creatively in the past.  We will also look at broader examples about what the artwork teaches us about code and algorithmic approaches.  For example, seminal works like Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv's "Text Rain" can be used as a starting point for discussing computer vision based interaction.  The class takes inspiration from the re:code project which aims to recode older media artworks, and participants will be invited through homework assignments to contribute.  

For now, most of the class has been organized via [hackpad](https://fallsfpc2015.hackpad.com/Recreating-the-past-Hk3Yl8oxPSe), but I am putting up a repo now for code examples and to link to folks homeworks / examples.
